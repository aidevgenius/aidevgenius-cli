### Creating an Installer Plugin

aidevgenius uses an auto-discovery system for installers. To add a new tool (e.g. `aidevgenius install mytool`):

1. Create a new bash script at `lib/installers/mytool.sh`.
2. Define a `cmd_install()` function inside it.
3. Source and use shared helpers from `_base.sh` automatically.
4. Commit and push: it will automatically be available to all users!
